# MidiPianoRico
_Two MIDI keyboard programs based on the C# MIDI toolkit from https://github.com/tebjan/Sanford.Multimedia.Midi_
- MidiPianoRico to show songs and let the user play them.
- PitchPlease to train sight reading. 

Made to use with my M-Audio Keystation 61 MKII and it's extra buttons, which use the Mackie/HUI protocol.
